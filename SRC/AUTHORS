With help from:

The late W. Richard Stevens, author of the book "Unix network
programming" for his book and his many examples (a lot of the code
comes from him by copy-and-paste).

Pierre Beyssac <pb@fasterix.freenix.org> author of the "bing" tool for
examples of code and beta-testing.

Christian Grimm <grimm@rvs.uni-hannover.de> for the ICP code.

Samuel Tardieu <sam@inf.enst.fr> for the SMTP code.

Pierre-Yves Lochou <lochou@ilog.fr> for a lot of testing, debugging
and porting.

Glen Turner <glen.turner@aarnet.edu.au> for the Type Of Service code.

Munechika Sumikawa <sumikawa@ebina.hitachi.co.jp>, from the KAME
project, for the getaddrinfo() code, necessary for IPv6 support.

The Pasteur Institute because the work was done when working on the
French national Web cache project, while being an employee of the
Institute.
