With help from:

Richard Stevens, author of the book "Unix network programming"
for his book and his many examples (a lot of the code comes from
him by copy-and-paste).

Pierre Beyssac, author of the "bing" tool for examples of code
and beta-testing.

Christian Grimm for the ICP code.

Glen Turner <glen.turner@aarnet.edu.au> for the Type Of Service code.

The Pasteur Institute because the work was done when working on the
French national Web cache project, while being an employee of the
Institute.
